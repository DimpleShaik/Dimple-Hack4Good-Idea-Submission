        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<ul><li>AquaAlert provides an end-to-end flood prediction and response coordination platform. It integrates IoT water-level sensors, satellite weather feeds, and local dam data into one intelligent dashboard. Using predictive analytics, the system forecasts flood risks and automatically sends early warnings to affected communities via SMS, email, or mobile push notifications.</li><li>For authorities, AquaAlert generates interactive maps highlighting high-risk zones and resource allocation needs (like rescue boats or shelters). Automated workflows trigger emergency response tasks for the right departments — ensuring coordinated action before disaster strikes.</li><li>After the flood, AquaAlert tracks recovery efforts, infrastructure restoration progress, and generates sustainability reports showing response effectiveness and future risk reduction insights.</li></ul>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Flood-prone regions often suffer catastrophic damage due to delayed or inaccurate alerts. Current systems are fragmented — weather data, dam release schedules, and river sensors are managed by different agencies, leading to slow response and lack of coordination during emergencies.</problem_statement>
